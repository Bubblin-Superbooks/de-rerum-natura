And no true thing in number of all things
Exists but fire, as this same fellow says,
Seems crazed folly. For the man himself
Against the senses by the senses fights,
And hews at that through which is all belief,
Through which indeed unto himself is known

The senses truly can perceive the fire,
He thinks they cannot as regards all else,
Which still are palpably as clear to senseâ€”
To me a thought inept and crazy too.

More certain than our senses can there be
Whereby to mark asunder error and truth?

And wish to allow heat only, then deny
The fire and still allow all else to</pre></div> </div>
