Down at his heels; and there he'd damn himself
For his fatuity, observing how

All the-behind-the-scenes of life from those
Whom they desire to keep in bonds of love—

Drag all the matter forth into the light
And well search out the cause of all these smiles;
And if of graceful mind she be and kind,
Do thou, in thy turn, overlook the same,
And thus allow for poor mortality.
Nor sighs the woman always with feigned love,
Who links her body round man's body locked
And holds him fast, making his kisses</pre></div> </div>
