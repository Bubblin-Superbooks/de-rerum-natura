Within the mind wherethrough the idol-films
Of just those games can come. And thus it is
For many a day thereafter those appear
Floating before the eyes, that even awake

And view the same assembly on the seats,
And manifold bright glories of the stageâ€”

And of the affairs wherein 'thas been the wont
Of men to be engaged-nor only men,

Thou'lt see the sturdy horses, though outstretched,
Yet sweating in their sleep, and panting ever,
And straining utmost strength, as if for prize,
As if, with barriers opened</pre></div> </div>
