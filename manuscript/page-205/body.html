Now, of what body, what components formed
Is this same mind I will go on to tell.

Most round, most tiny, that they may be moved,
When hit by impulse slight. So water moves,
In waves along, at impulse just the least—

But, contrariwise, the quality of honey
More stable is, its liquids more</pre></div> </div>
