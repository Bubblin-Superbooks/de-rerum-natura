And what besides of those first particles
Whence soul and mind must fashioned be?—Seest not
How nice and how minute? Besides, whatever
Exhales from out its body a sharp smell—
The nauseous absinth, or the panacea,
Strong southernwood, or bitter centaury—
If never so lightly with thy \[fingers\] twain
Perchance \[thou touch\] a one of them

Flit hither and thither, many, in many modes,
Bodiless and invisible?

But lest
Haply thou holdest that those images
Which come from objects are the sole that flit,
Others indeed there be of own</pre></div> </div>
