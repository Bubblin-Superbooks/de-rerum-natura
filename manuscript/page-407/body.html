There is no overflow; in part because
The burly winds (that over-sweep amain)

Through all the lands. The brine is filtered off,
And then the liquid stuff seeps back again
And all regathers at the river-heads,
Whence in fresh-water currents on it flows
Over the lands, adown the channels which
Were cleft erstwhile and erstwhile bore along
The liquid-footed floods.

Is changed innumerably. For</pre></div> </div>
